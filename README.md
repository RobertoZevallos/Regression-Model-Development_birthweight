# Supervised Learning Regression Model Development

Used information of birthweights to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (birthweights). The analysis includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

The regression models that were developed are:
1. OLS Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

The final output of the Jupyter notebook is a table of the candidate models that shows the model type, training and testing scores, train-test gap, and the final model selection.
